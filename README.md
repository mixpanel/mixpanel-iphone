# Introduction

The Mixpanel library for iOS is an open source project, and we'd love to see your contributions! We'd also love for you to come and work with us! Check out https://mixpanel.com/jobs/#openings for details.

If you are using Swift, we recommend our **[Swift Library](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-swift)**.

# Installation

<a name="cocoapods"></a>
## CocoaPods

Mixpanel supports `CocoaPods` for easy installation.
To Install, see our **[full documentation »](https://mixpanel.com/help/reference/ios)**

#### iOS, tvOS, watchOS, macOS: 
`pod 'Mixpanel'`

<a name="carthage"></a>
## Carthage

Mixpanel also supports `Carthage` to package your dependencies as a framework.
Check out the **[Carthage docs »](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)** for more info.

To integrate Mixpanel into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Mixpanel.framework` into your Xcode project.

<a name="manual-installation"></a>
## Manual Installation

To help users stay up to date with the latests version of our iOS SDK, we always recommend integrating our SDK via CocoaPods, which simplifies version updates and dependency management. However, there are cases where users can't use CocoaPods. Not to worry, just follow these manual installation steps and you'll be all set.

### Step 1: Add as a submodule

Add Mixpanel as a submodule to your local git repo like so:

```
git submodule add git@github.com:mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone.git
```

Now the Mixpanel project and its files should be in your project folder!

### Step 2: Add the SDK to your app!

Drag and drop Mixpanel.xcodeproj from the mixpanel-iphone folder into your Xcode Project Workspace:

### Step 3: Import the Mixpanel framework

Add Mixpanel.framework under "Linked Frameworks and Libaries" to your app.

<a name="integrate"></a>
# Integrate

Import <Mixpanel/Mixpanel.h> into AppDelegate.m, and initialize Mixpanel within `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`

```objective-c
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import <Mixpanel/Mixpanel.h>

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [Mixpanel sharedInstanceWithToken:MIXPANEL_TOKEN];
}
```

You initialize your Mixpanel instance with the token provided to you on mixpanel.com.

<a name="start-tracking"></a>
# Start tracking

After installing the library into your iOS app, Mixpanel will <a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/questions/articles/which-common-mobile-events-can-mixpanel-collect-on-my-behalf-automatically" target="_blank">automatically collect common mobile events</a>. You can enable/ disable automatic collection through your <a href="https://mixpanel.com/help/questions/articles/how-do-i-enable-common-mobile-events-if-i-have-already-implemented-mixpanel" target="_blank">project settings</a>.

Tracking additional events is as easy as adding `track:` or `track:properties:` anywhere after initializing Mixpanel.

```objective-c
[[Mixpanel sharedInstance] track:@"Event name"];
[[Mixpanel sharedInstance] track:@"Event name" properties:@{@"Prop name": @"Prop value"}];
```

You're done! You've successfully integrated the Mixpanel SDK into your app. To stay up to speed on important SDK releases and updates watch our iPhone repository on [Github](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone).
