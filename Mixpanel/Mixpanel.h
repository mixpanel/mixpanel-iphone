 Sets the distinct ID of the current user.

 As of version 2.3.1, Mixpanel will choose a default distinct ID based on
 whether you are using the AdSupport.framework or not.

 If you are not using the AdSupport Framework (iAds), then we use the
 <code>[UIDevice currentDevice].identifierForVendor</code> (IFV) string as the
 default distinct ID.  This ID will identify a user across all apps by the same
 vendor, but cannot be used to link the same user across apps from different
 vendors.

 If you are showing iAds in your application, you are allowed use the iOS ID
 for Advertising (IFA) to identify users. If you have this framework in your
 app, Mixpanel will use the IFA as the default distinct ID. If you have
 AdSupport installed but still don't want to use the IFA, you can define the
 <code>MIXPANEL_NO_IFA</code> preprocessor flag in your build settings, and
 Mixpanel will use the IFV as the default distinct ID.

 If we are unable to get an IFA or IFV, we will fall back to generating a
 random persistent UUID.

 For tracking events, you do not need to call <code>identify:</code> if you
 want to use the default.  However, <b>Mixpanel People always requires an
 explicit call to <code>identify:</code></b>. If calls are made to
 <code>set:</code>, <code>increment</code> or other <code>MixpanelPeople</code>
 methods prior to calling <code>identify:</code>, then they are queued up and
 flushed once <code>identify:</code> is called.

 If you'd like to use the default distinct ID for Mixpanel People as well
 (recommended), call <code>identify:</code> using the current distinct ID:
 <code>[mixpanel identify:mixpanel.distinctId]</code>.
