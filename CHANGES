Changes with version v2.3.5					18 April 2014

2.3.5: General bug fixes and improvements.

This release contains the following:    - Image assets are in an Asset
Catalog  - Podspec updated for Cocoapods 0.31.1  - Removed 'unused
variable' warnings.  - We are now using `boundingRectWithSize` on iOS7
to compute font size for notifications  - Show notifications on the
topmost *visible* view so they aren't hidden inside invisible views.
- Only track notifications when they are *really* shown.  - Fixed
crash bug when tracking wifi/radio connectivity properties.


Changes with version v2.0.6					21 March 2014

Backport for v2.2.3 fixes to archiving.

This is a backport for apps that have not upgraded to ARC and intend
to support iOS 5. It is NOT intended to be the latest release.
Info:  Fixed an issue where archiving synchronously on the serial
queue would block indefinitely.


Changes with version v2.3.4					19 March 2014

Reverted some changes from v2.3.3 to fix Podspec lint issues

Commits relating to XCode 5.1 warning suppression were reverted
because Cocoapods would not accept the podspec with a warning
suppression compiler flag. These commits will return in a later
release when we can find a cleaner solution.


Changes with version v2.3.3					14 March 2014

Fix for Landscape Takeovers Notifs, Tiny fixes for Xcode 5.1

In-App notifications set to type takeover were crashing landscape-only
apps. This version filters them out and logs the issue silently.
Xcode 5.1 presented some new warnings having to do with typecasting
(from double to float) that were fixed.


Changes with version v2.3.2					19 February 2014

Minor fix to in-app tracking timestamps

```[NSDate timeSinceReferenceDate]``` does not produce a standard unix
timestamp and was being used in an in-app notifications tracking call.
By changing it to ```[NSDate date]```, the mixpanel library  is able
to handle the conversion from an NSDate object to the appropriate
timestamp further down the line.    This tracking call only affects a
planned dashboard for in-app notifications and will not cause any
noticeable or functional changes to apps regardless of whether or not
they are using the feature.


Changes with version v2.3.1					04 February 2014

Only use IFA if AdSupport is included.

As of this version (2.3.1) Mixpanel no longer requires the
AdSupport.framework due to reports of app-store rejections for apps
that do not serve ads where Mixpanel is using the IFA to identify
users    From now on, Mixpanel will detect if the host application is
using AdSupport.framework and, if so, will automatically continue to
use IFA as the default identifier. For apps that do not serve ads and
do not have the AdSupport.framework included, Mixpanel will now
default to using the identifierForVendor (IFV).    Also thanks to
@orta, @ksm, and @dblock for some other bugfixes in this release.


Changes with version v2.3.0					22 January 2014

In-App Notifications

This release includes the new in-app notifications feature. See
https://mixpanel.com/inapp-notifications/


Changes with version v2.2.3					10 January 2014

Archive bug fix

Fixed an issue where archiving was locking up the main app thread when
a user backgrounded and immediately foregrounded his or her app.
Archiving also now copies relevant queue objects before archiving them
to avoid errors associated with nonatomic modifying of the originals.


Changes with version v2.2.2					19 December 2013

Fix survey presentation bug

There were circumstances where the Mixpanel library would attempt to
show a survey on top of a ViewController that was itself in the
process of going through a presentation transition, leading to a
NSInternalInconsistencyException.     This release fixes the issue by
making sure that the current ViewController is not in the process of
being presented before showing a survey.


Changes with version v2.0.5					10 December 2013

Add MIXPANEL_NO_IFA to older version of lib

Apple's app review team may reject apps that use the AdSupport
framework's advertisingIdentifier (IFA) but do not show ads. The
MIXPANEL_NO_IFA preprocessor macro—you can set it in your target's
XCode build settings—will strip IFA usage out of the Mixpanel lib.
Instead of IFA, we'll use UIDevice's identifierForVendor as the
default Mixpanel distinct ID.    This functionality is already in the
most recent versions of the lib. However, apps that still want to
support iOS 5 must use the 2.0.x releases. This release makes
MIXPANEL_NO_IFA available to them.


Changes with version v2.2.1					05 December 2013

Fix bug using surveys with iOS6.

This release fixes a bug in version 2.2.0 of the Mixpanel library
where surveys shown iOS6 devices would cause an application crash.
#### Cause    We switched to using [boundingRectWithSize:options:attri
butes:context:](https://developer.apple.com/library/iOS/documentation/
UIKit/Reference/NSString_UIKit_Additions/Reference/Reference.html#//ap
ple_ref/occ/instm/NSString/boundingRectWithSize:options:attributes:con
text:) instead of the deprecated [sizeWithFont:](https://developer.app
le.com/library/iOS/documentation/UIKit/Reference/NSString_UIKit_Additi
ons/DeprecationAppendix/AppendixADeprecatedAPI.html#//apple_ref/occ/in
stm/NSString/sizeWithFont:) without doing a runtime check to see if
the feature was supported on the user's device.    #### Affected users
Users were affected if all the following conditions were met.   - The
user was running iOS6  - They were running an app using Mixpanel
library v2.2.0  - They were shown a [survey](https://mixpanel.com
/mobile-surveys/)    #### Solution    This release (2.2.1) fixes the
issue in the Mixpanel library. We have also modified our server code
so that affected users will *not* be shown surveys, and will therefore
not encounter the bug.


Changes with version v2.2.0					20 November 2013

ARC Compatibility

This release makes the Mixpanel library ARC compatible.    If you were
previously using this library in an ARC-enabled project and you were
using the `-fno-objc-arc` flag on all Mixpanel files, you can now
remove that flag.     If you are using Mixpanel in a project that
*doesn't* have ARC enabled, you will have to add the `-fobjc-arc` flag
to all the Mixpanel files.     You can add and remove compiler flags
on a per-file basis in XCode, in your project settings under `Build
Phases > Compile Sources`.


Changes with version v2.1.0					30 October 2013

Surveys

Adds Mixpanel Surveys functionality.


Changes with version v2.0.4					24 October 2013

Super property persistence fix

Improves reliability of archiving and flushing on background.


Changes with version v2.0.3					21 October 2013

Time bug fix

We were setting the time on events and records inside async blocks.
This resulted in incorrect, delayed time values. Time is now set at
the moment track: or any of the Mixpanel People property methods,
e.g., set:, append:, etc., are called.


Changes with version v2.0.2					12 September 2013

64-bit compatibilty

Adds some required casting for 64-bit builds.


Changes with version 2.0.0                                         25 Apr 2013

    * New [mixpanel identify:], removed [mixpanel.people identify:]. 

        IMPORTANT: We used to have a separate [mixpanel.people identify:]
        method. You had to call it before we'd flush people records. It's gone
        (hence incrementing the major version number for this release). The new
        behavior is this: events will go right away with default distinct ID.
        People records will be queued until identify: is called. At that point
        the distinct ID used in identify: is used for both events and people
        records. if you want to use the default ID for people, use [mixpanel
        identify:mixpanel.distinctId];

    * Distinct ID defaults to iOS IFA for iOS 6+ and falls back to ODIN1

    * New automatic properties:
        
        $app_release and $ios_app_release (for Engagement and People,
        respectively) which are CFBundleShortVersionString. Note: old
        $ios_app_version remains for backward compatibility.

        $ios_ifa 

    * Added setOnce:

    * Added unregisterSuperProperty:
